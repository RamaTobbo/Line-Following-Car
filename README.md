# Line Following Car Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple line-following car using sensors and a microcontroller. The car uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjusts its movement to follow the path automatically. This project showcases basic robotics, sensor integration, and motor control.

## Features

- **Line Following:** The car autonomously follows a line on the ground using IR sensors.
- **Adjustable Speed:** The speed of the motors can be adjusted based on the code or hardware settings.
- **Simple Design:** The project uses affordable and easy-to-find components, making it beginner-friendly.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino 
- **IR Sensors:** Used for detecting the line 
- **DC Motors:** For driving the car
- **Motor Driver Module:**  L298N 
- **Chassis:**  ready-made car chassis
- **Battery Pack:** To power the car with 7.4V Li-ion battery
- **Wheels:** For movement
- **Jumper Wires and Connectors**
